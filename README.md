# Becoming of Framework PRO
followed/done/learned from [course](https://garyclarketech.teachable.com/p/php-framework-pro) by [Gary Clarke](https://www.garyclarke.tech/).
I have learned alot of new(to me) exciting concepts.
Framework:[Logic](https://github.com/Aimocs/frame/tree/main/framework)
Application:[Logic](https://github.com/Aimocs/frame/tree/main/src),[Routes](https://github.com/Aimocs/frame/blob/main/routes/web.php)
Truly a relieve to have understood how web frameworks function.
